# Quick Sort Algorithm in Assembly

## Introduction
This is a good practice to write a "realistic" program in assembly. 

You can find a C program named **quick_sort.c**, it is a c program that implements the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm. You can test it via:
```sh
gcc quick_sort.c && ./a.out
```

Another file named **quick_sort.asm** is the assembly version of **quick_sort.c**.  To run it, you can use MARS, a MIPS Simulator.

## MIPS Simulator--MARS
Please use the MARS simulator, and especially its singlestep/backstep feature. This will make your debugging much easier. Note that Mars supports various print commands as system calls (using syscall). For more usage and debugging information, see [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/Help/MarsHelpIntro.html).
